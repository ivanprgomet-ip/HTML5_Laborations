        <h2>About the hobby</h2>
        <section>

            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Ivan Prgomet and my favourite hobby is to <mark>code</mark> and spend <q>quality time</q> 
                with my computer. When I <mark>code</mark>, I rarely ever get everything right from the beginning. The trial and 
                error involved with programming is just part of the <em><mark>code</mark>-game</em>, I guess. 
                The <mark>coding</mark> languages that I like to work with <abbr title="at the moment">atm</abbr> <!--could also have used <acronym> but its obsolete-->
                are <strong>C#, SQL and Html5,</strong>.

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Coding</mark> is my favourite hobby because I love solving problems that require deep understanding of the problem. The feeling of a solved code-problem is very satisfactory when the process of solving it involved structured planning, deep focus of the problem itself, and normaly lots of trial and errors. I guess that is the main essence of why I like coding so much.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason for my interest in programming is that the world of programming is constantly changing, and therefore never gets boring! There is always so much happening (such as new techniques and conventions etc.) in the programming world, that one simply doesn't have the time to be bored. This dynamic characteristic of code is truly inspirational and motivates me to keep striving for new grounds and knowledges. The only sad thing about programming is that one cannot simply learn it all!
            </p>

            <h3>Other Interests?</h3>
            <p>
                Other than programming, I try to work out at the gym. This is primarily to stay moderately healthy 
                (due to all the excessive sitting). I also like to listen to music and take walks outside.

        <h2>Programming Language</h2>
        <a>
            A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, 
            particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a 
            machine or to express algorithms. HTML5 (markup language) is not usually considered a programming language, 
            but I will still include it down below.

        <h2>About the Programming Languages</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>C#</h3>
            <p>
                C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative,
                declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
                It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and
                ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg.
                The most recent version is C# 6.0, which was released on July 20, 2015.
            </p>

            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <p>
                SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held
                in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
                management system (RDSMS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language,
                data manipulation language, and a data control language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete,
                schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is,
                a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper,
                "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks. Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model
                as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.
            </p>
            <p>
                SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization
                for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features.
                Despite the existence of such standards, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems without
                adjustments.

            <h3>HTML5</h3>
            <p>
                HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
                It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the language with support 
                for the latest multimedia, while keeping it easily readable by humans—and consistently understood by computers 
                and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, 
                but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, 
                improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming 
                interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform 
                mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, 
                the new &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt; elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) 
                content and MathML for mathematical formulas. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements 
                such as &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;figure&gt;, are added. 
                New attributes are introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed, and others such as &lt;a&gt;, &lt;cite&gt; and &lt;menu&gt; 
                have been changed, redefined or standardized.
            </p>
            <p>
                The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.
            </p>
