        <h2>About the hobby</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>
                My favourite hobby (atm) is to <mark>code</mark> and spend time with my computer.
                When <mark>coding</mark>, me and my computer don't always get along but thats
                part of the <em><mark>code</mark>-game</em>. The <mark>coding</mark> includes <strong>C#, Html, SQL</strong> etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Coding</mark> is my favourite hobby because I love solving problems through trial
                and error. The feeling of a solved programatic problem is huge when the process
                of solving it has involved deep focus of the problem together with trial and error.
            </p>
            <h3>Other hobbies?</h3>
            <p>
                I like to work out at the gym, but i don't consider it a direct hobby.
                It's more of a duty to stay healthy (because <mark>coding</mark>, generally, involves alot of sitting).
