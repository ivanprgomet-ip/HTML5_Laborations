    <h1>Just a hobby</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Below is a short description of my current hobby</p>

        <h2>About the hobby</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>
                My favourite hobby (atm) is to code and spend time with my computer.
                When programming, me and my computer don't always get along but thats
                part of the code-game. The coding includes C#, Html,  SQL etc. 
            </p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                Coding is my favourite hobby because I love solving problems through trial
                and error. The feeling of a solved programatic problem is huge when the process
                of solving it has involved deep focus of the problem together with trial and error.
            </p>
            <h3>Other hobbies?</h3>
            <p>
                I like to work out sometimes, but i dont consider it a hobby. 
                It's more of a duty to stay healthy (because my hobby involves alot of sitting).
