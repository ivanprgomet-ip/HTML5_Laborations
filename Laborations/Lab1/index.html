        <h2>About the hobby</h2>
        <section>

            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>
                My favourite hobby is to <mark>code</mark> and <q>spend time</q> with my computer.
                When <mark>coding</mark>, me and my computer don't always get along but thats
                part of the <em><mark>code</mark>-game</em>, I guess. The <mark>coding</mark> includes languages such as<strong>C#, Html, SQL</strong> etc.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Coding</mark> is my favourite hobby because I love solving problems through trial
                and error. The feeling of a solved programatic problem is huge when the process
                of solving it has involved deep focus of the problem together with trial and error.

            <h3>Other hobbies/interests?</h3>
            <p>
                I like to work out when I have time. Mainly to stay healthy (due to sitting so much when <mark>coding</mark>).

        <h2>About C# and SQL</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>C#</h3>
            <p>
                C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative,
                declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
                It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and
                ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg.
                The most recent version is C# 6.0, which was released on July 20, 2015.

            <h3>T-SQL</h3>
            <p>
                SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held
                in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
                management system (RDSMS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language,
                data manipulation language, and a data control language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete,
                schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is,
                a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper,
                "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks. Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model
                as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.
            </p>
            <p>
                SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization
                for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features.
                Despite the existence of such standards, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems without
                adjustments.
