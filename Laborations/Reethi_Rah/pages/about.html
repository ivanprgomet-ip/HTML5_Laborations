            <h2>History &amp; Culture</h2>
            <p>Ancient traditions and a reverence for nature.</p>
            <p>Formerly known as 'King's Island,' the Maldives is a surreal land of blue lagoons and soft white sands awash in an ocean of teal and indigo. Its beguiling name means ‘garland of islands’ in Dhivehi, the local language. Although no one knows who first named this glittering archipelago that stretches north-to-south across the equator, explorers, traders and travellers have been coming here for centuries – each generation as enchanted as the last.

            Very little has changed since ancient mariners first sailed these seas. Just one-sixth of the country’s 1,190 islands are inhabited – mostly peaceful fishing villages nestled among the palms. The Maldives today remains a necklace of soft sand atolls laid out on the shimmering azure waters of the Indian Ocean.

            Maldivian culture is a distinctive blend of the different influences that have shaped the isles over the years – from African drumming to Oriental jewellery-work. Perhaps the most important element is ‘bodu beru,’ the huge drum (made of coconut wood and either goat hide or manta ray skin!) that gives its name to the hypnotically rhythmic traditional form of music and dance.</p>

            <h2>General info</h2>
            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>
                The Maldives has a pleasant equatorial climate, with two main seasons. November to April is light and fairly dry. May to October occasionally brings brief rain showers followed by sunshine. Temperatures range from mid 20s to mid 30s C (77 to 95 F).
            </p>
            <h3>Visa</h3>
            <p>
                A visa is not required in advance of travelling to the Republic of the Maldives; however, travellers will be issued a 30-day visitor permit upon arrival. To receive this, each traveller must present a passport (valid for at least six months), and a valid return air ticket to a destination where the passenger has permission to enter together with any visa required for that destination. 
            </p>
            <h3>Currency</h3>
            <p>
                Local currency is the Maldivian rufiyaa. Whilst all billings are made in US dollars, most other foreign currencies can be exchanged at the resort. Please note, however, that the Maldivian rufiyaa cannot be exchanged for any other currency. 
            </p>
            <h3>Time Zone</h3>

            <h3>Electricity</h3>
