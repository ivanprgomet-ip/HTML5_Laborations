                <h3>about</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[5]) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.[6]
                    It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[7] Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the
                    three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is
                    supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions,
                    making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[8] imperative, and functional programming styles.[6]
                    It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as
                    networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.[7]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated
                    and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and
                    design are influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages.[9]
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers,
                    and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also
                    increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications. On the client side, JavaScript has been
                    traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation.
                    It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and mobile applications, and server-side network
                    programming with runtime environments such as Node.js.
                </p>

                <h3>Use in Web Pages</h3>
                <p>
                    The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to HTML pages, a.k.a. Dynamic HTML (DHTML).
                    Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.
                    Some simple examples of this usage are:
                </p>

                <ul id="web_use">
                    <li>
                        Loading new page content or submitting data to the server via AJAX without reloading the page
                        (for example, a social network might allow the user to post status updates without leaving the page)
                    </li>
                    <li>Animation of page elements, fading them in and out, resizing them, moving them, etc.</li>
                    <li>Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video</li>
                    <li>Validating input values of a Web form to make sure that they are acceptable before being submitted to the server.</li>
                    <li>
                        Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites.
                        Web pages frequently do this for Web analytics, ad tracking, personalization or other purposes.[60]
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server),
                    the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an application more responsive. Furthermore,
                    JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications
                    such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript
                    dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of
                    Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript engine (also known as JavaScript interpreter or JavaScript implementation) is an interpreter
                    that interprets JavaScript source code and executes the script accordingly. The first JavaScript engine was
                    created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation, for the Netscape Navigator Web browser.
                    The engine, code-named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C. It has since been updated (in JavaScript 1.5) to conform to
                    ECMA-262 Edition 3. The Rhino engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (formerly of Netscape; now at Google)
                    is a JavaScript implementation in Java. Rhino, like SpiderMonkey, is ECMA-262 Edition 3 compliant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Web browser is by far the most common host environment for JavaScript. Web browsers typically create "host objects"
                    to represent the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. The Web server is another common host environment.
                    A JavaScript Web server would typically expose host objects representing HTTP request and response objects,
                    which a JavaScript program could then interrogate and manipulate to dynamically generate Web pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because JavaScript is the only language that the most popular browsers share support for, it has become a target language
                    for many frameworks in other languages, even though JavaScript was never intended to be such a language.[61]
                    Despite the performance limitations inherent to its dynamic nature, the increasing speed of JavaScript engines has
                    made the language a surprisingly feasible compilation target.

            <h2 id="aboutdhtml">Dynamic HTML</h2>
            <p class="pretext">Below is some information about dynamic html (dhtml)!</p>
            <section>
                <h3>about</h3>
                <p>
                    Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is an umbrella term for a collection of technologies used together to create
                    interactive and animated web sites[1] by using a combination of a static markup language (such as HTML),
                    a client-side scripting language (such as JavaScript), a presentation definition language (such as CSS),
                    and the Document Object Model.[2] The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of
                    Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHTML allows scripting languages to change variables in a web page's definition language, which in turn
                    affects the look and function of otherwise "static" HTML page content, after the page has been fully loaded
                    and during the viewing process. Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page
                    is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By contrast, a dynamic web page is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user,
                    load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting, and ones
                    created by server-side scripting (such as PHP, Perl, JSP or ASP.NET) where the web server generates content
                    before sending it to the client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHTML is differentiated from Ajax by the fact that a DHTML page is still request/reload-based.
                    With DHTML, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded;
                    all processing happens in JavaScript on the client side. By contrast, an Ajax page uses features of DHTML to
                    initiate a request (or 'subrequest') to the server to perform actions such as loading more content.

                <h3>Uses</h3>
                <p>
                    DHTML allows authors to add effects to their pages that are otherwise difficult to achieve.
                    In short words: scripting language is changing the DOM and page style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply put, DHTML is the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Animate text and images in their document, independently moving each element from any
                        starting point to any ending point, following a predetermined path or one chosen by the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Embed a ticker that automatically refreshes its content with the latest news, stock quotes, or other data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a form to capture user input, and then process, verify and respond to that data
                        without having to send data back to the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Include rollover buttons or drop-down menus.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    A less common use is to create browser-based action games. Although a number of games were
                    created using DHTML during the late 1990s and early 2000s,[citation needed], differences between
                    browsers made this difficult: many techniques had to be implemented in code to enable the games
                    to work on multiple platforms. Recently browsers have been converging towards web standards,
                    which has made the design of DHTML games more viable. Those games can be played on all major
                    browsers and they can also be ported to Plasma for KDE, Widgets for OS X and Gadgets for Windows
                    Vista, which are based on DHTML code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term "DHTML" has fallen out of use in recent years as it was associated with practices and
                    conventions that tended to not work well between various web browsers. DHTML may now be referred
                    to as unobtrusive JavaScript coding (DOM Scripting), in an effort to place an emphasis on
                    agreed-upon best practices while allowing similar effects in an accessible, standards-compliant way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHTML support with extensive DOM access was introduced with Internet Explorer 4.0.
                    Although there was a basic dynamic system with Netscape Navigator 4.0, not all HTML elements
                    were represented in the DOM. When DHTML-style techniques became widespread, varying degrees of
                    support among web browsers for the technologies involved made them difficult to develop and debug.
                    Development became easier when Internet Explorer 5.0+, Mozilla Firefox 2.0+, and Opera 7.0+ adopted
                    a shared DOM inherited from ECMAscript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More recently, JavaScript libraries such as jQuery have abstracted away many of the day-to-day
                    difficulties in cross-browser DOM manipulation.
